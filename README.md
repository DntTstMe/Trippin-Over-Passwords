# Trippin-Over-Passwords
Randomly generates a password with various criteria that can be selected by the user. 

## Description

* My motivation for this project was to exercise my recently learned Javascript skills to create a random password generator that meets accepted critera for the user.
* I created this project so I could test my use of variables, functions and for and while statements while also having fun creating the generator.
* This project solves the problem of creating a generic password by randomly generating a password with various options such as special characters, numbers or uppercase and lowercase letters.
* I learned that dedicating your time and putting in the work is both rewarding and enlightening. I learned a lot and feel more confident in myself than I did previously.
* I feel that my project stands out because it is a piece of me that I put lots of hardwork and time into it so that I could feel proud of how far I have already come in the program.
